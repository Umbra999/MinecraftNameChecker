# MinecraftNameChecker
I used this to check the availability of OG Names for Labymod but this can also used to fetch names in General, you can find the Labymod OG list here:
https://github.com/LabyMod/og-names

Usage:
Create a File named Names.txt and write the names you want to check in (new line = new name)
After all checks are done it writes all Names to a new txt called Available.txt
